  <h4>But who am I to give you such recommendations?</h4>
  <p>Hi! My name's Dasha and I'm 24. I chose this topic for a reason. The point is that throughout my life I have been trying to lose weight, which caused me discomfort for so many years. I gave up so many times...</p>
  <p>That is why I would like to share my own experience with you, because I know how difficult it is to find time, energy and motivation. One of my favorite sayings is "No pain, no gain", so forget about all this "clever fitness" stuff, get up and change your life with me.</p>
